1. Software Requirements (Prerequisites)
Before writing code, ensure your computer has:

Python (Version 3.8 or higher): To run the backend logic.

VS Code (Visual Studio Code): The code editor to manage files.

Web Browser: Google Chrome, Edge, or Firefox to test the website.

2. Python Libraries (Backend Dependencies)
You must install these libraries to make the AI work. Run this command in your terminal:
pip install flask flask-cors pandas scikit-learn openpyxl

Flask: Creates the web server.

Flask-CORS: Allows the frontend to talk to the backend.

Pandas: Reads the Excel/CSV data files.

Scikit-Learn: Builds the AI models (Random Forest).

Openpyxl: Reads Excel files (if your data is .xlsx).

3. Dataset Requirements (The "Brain" Data)
You need two specific CSV files in your project folder.

File 1 (Soil Data): Smart_Agriculture_10000_Rows_Final_No_Unknown.xlsx - Sheet1.csv

Columns: State, District, Soil_Type, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Crop, Yield, Fertilizer.

File 2 (History Data): Smart_Agriculture_10000_Rows.xlsx - Historical_Based.csv

Columns: State, Season, Soil_Type, Previous_Crop, Recommended_Crop.

4. Folder Structure Requirement
Your project must be organized exactly like this for the code to work:

Plaintext
AgriProject/
├── app.py                   (The Python Backend)
├── requirements.txt         (List of libraries)
├── [Your_2_CSV_Files_Here]
└── public/
    ├── index.html           (The Website UI)
    ├── dashboard.css        (The Styling)
    └── logic.js             (The Connecting Logic)
5. Hardware Requirements
Computer: Any standard laptop or PC (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

Internet: Required only to install libraries and load fonts/icons (FontAwesome). The app itself runs offline locally once installed.

Microphone: Required if you want to test the "Voice Input" feature.

6. Functional Requirements (What the App Does)
Prediction: Must predict Crop, Yield, and Fertilizer based on soil inputs.

Dual Mode: Must support both "Soil Analysis" and "Historical Trend" prediction.

Language: Must support switching between English, Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil.

Voice: Must accept voice input for the "State" field.

Chatbot: Must answer basic farming questions (Rule-based).

Resilience: Must show a "Demo Result" if the backend is offline, so the UI never breaks.
